# Salinity-Prediction-Model
Predicting Salinity using Machine Learning Algorithms with different inputs. 
Water management requires a lot of laboratory work, and the conventional way of assessment is very time-consuming and cumbersome. Using predictive modeling can solve this problem. Using machine learning algorithms, I predicted the Salinity of the Karnaphuli river and the results were very accurate. Two prediction models was created, one parameter-based which takes different water quality parameters to predict the salinity and another one time-series-based that predicts the salinity based on sampling station, month and year.
