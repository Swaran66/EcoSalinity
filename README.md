# Salinity-Prediction-Model
Predicting Salinity using Machine Learning Algorithms with different inputs. 
Water management requires a lot of laboratory work, and the conventional way of assessment is very time-consuming and cumbersome. Using predictive modeling can solve this problem. Using machine learning algorithms, I will try to predict the Salinity of the Karnaphuli river. Two predictION models will be created, one parameter-based and another one time-series-based.
